## ABOUT:

The user begins by clicking on a card and avoiding clicking the same card twice. After a card is clicked the state changes by rendering a new message and adding points to the scoreboard. All of the cards are shuffled after every click so the user has to be careful not to click the same card or the game restarts. If the user score reaches 12 they get a winning message and the game restarts.
